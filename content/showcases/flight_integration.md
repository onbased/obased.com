In the aviation industry, integrating flight data from various sources is critical for ensuring operational efficiency and decision-making accuracy. This showcase highlights how we handle multiple update streams from diverse sources (A, B, C, D, E, F) to create a single, consistent, and curated flight view. Our approach ensures data quality improvement and prevents downgrades using a specialized mechanism called the **Master Matrix**.

## The Challenge: Multiple Data Streams, One Flight View

Flight data arrives from several sources, each providing updates on flight attributes such as:

- Departure and arrival times
- Aircraft type
- Operational status
- Gate and stand assignments
- Passenger counts

However, these sources often provide conflicting information. For example, source A might update the gate assignment, while source B reports a different value. Integrating these updates into a unified and accurate flight entity requires prioritization to ensure data consistency and quality.

## The Solution: The Master Matrix

To address this, we developed the **Master Matrix**, a centralized framework that defines **attribute-level priorities** for each source. The Master Matrix ensures that:

1. **Data Consistency**: Conflicting updates from sources are resolved based on predefined priorities for each attribute.
2. **Data Quality Preservation**: Updates from lower-priority sources do not overwrite more valuable data already in the system.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Updates from higher-priority sources are allowed to replace lower-priority values, ensuring the data entity evolves and improves over time.

### How It Works

1. **Attribute Prioritization**:
   - Each flight attribute is mapped to a prioritized list of sources (e.g., A > B > C > D > E > F).
   - For example:
     - Gate assignment: A > D > F > C > B > E
     - Departure time: B > A > C > E > D > F

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - When an update for a specific attribute arrives, the system checks the source's priority against the current value's source in the Master Matrix.
   - If the new source has a **higher priority**, the update is accepted.
   - If the new source has a **lower or equal priority**, the current value is retained.

3. **Automation**:
   - The entire process is automated, ensuring real-time updates while maintaining data integrity.

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Prevents downgrades caused by unreliable or lower-priority sources.
- **Scalability**: Handles updates from multiple sources continuously.
- **Transparency**: Clear and auditable prioritization logic for each attribute.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual intervention in conflict resolution.

## Real-World Impact

By integrating flight data through the Master Matrix, we create a unified flight entity that is both reliable and dynamically improving. This capability supports critical operations for airlines, airports, and partners by providing high-quality data for:

- Real-time decision-making
- Process optimization
- Enhanced passenger experience

## Conclusion

The Flight Integration Showcase demonstrates how innovative data engineering solutions can transform complex, multi-source data into actionable insights. With the Master Matrix, we ensure that each flight view remains consistent, curated, and continuously improving.
